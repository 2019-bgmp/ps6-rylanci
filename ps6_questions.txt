6-pt3 Questions

1. Describe how the assembly changes with different k-mer values using the assembly
statistics you have collected. How does the contig length distribution change?

    Mean contig length increased dramatically with kmer length which suggest that there are
    more large contigs as kmer size increases. My N50 reflected that conclusion
    as well since it too rose as kmer size increased.

2. How does an increased coverage cutoff affect the assembly? What is happening to the
de Bruijin graph when you change the value of this parameter? How does velvet
calculate its value for ‘auto’?

    A higher coverage cut off would reduce the amount of low coverage kmers that
    would be included in the assembly. There are usually a large amount of These
    kmers so a higher cutoff often reduces the size of the assembly.

    The de Bruijin graph itself shrinks when coverage cutoff increases because
    the usually frequent low coverage nodes would not exist to the same degree.

    According to the manual velvet calculates its coverage cutoff for the auto
    option as half the length weighted median contig coverage depth.

3. How does increasing minimum contig length affect your contig length distribution and
N50?

    Increasing minimum contig length throws out all the contigs below that length limit
    from the assembly. This would mean that these contigs below the limit would be absent
    from my distribution driving N50 up because the proportion of long contigs to short would
    be greater than before.
