My unit test fasta file for ps6 contained 9 contigs. Their physical lengths
were [4812, 4355, 2220, 1202, 870, 601, 445, 431, 285]


The N50 calculated by hand from longest to shortest contig is 4355.
This is also the N50 calculated by my program. Unfortunately this unit test
does not check whether N50 is calculated from a list of contigs sorted longest to
shortest or shortest to longest, so that could be an improvement.

The mean contig length of 1691.22 and max kmer length of 4812 were also successfully
calculated by my program.

The bucketing algorithm also performed correctly with its output of..

These unit tests show that my program is capable of calulating these stats
correctly on larger files.
